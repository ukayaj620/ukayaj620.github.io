      <strong>Sukarno</strong> was the leader of the Indonesian struggle for
      independence from the Dutch colonialists. He was a prominent leader of
      Indonesia's nationalist movement during the colonial period and spent over
      a decade under Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese
      forces in World War II. Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated
      to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the population, in
      exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas. Upon Japanese
      surrender, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on
      17 August 1945, and Sukarno was appointed president. He led the Indonesian
      resistance to Dutch re-colonisation efforts via diplomatic and military
      means until the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence in 1949.

      <strong>Suharto or Soeharto</strong> (8 June 1921 - 27 January 2008) was
      an Indonesian army officer and politician, who served as the second and
      the longest serving president of Indonesia. Widely regarded as a military
      dictator by international observers, Suharto led Indonesia as an
      authoritarian regime from the fall of his predecessor Sukarno in 1967
      until his resignation in 1998 following nationwide unrest. His 32-year
      dictatorship is considered one of the most brutal and corrupt of the 20th
      century. Source:

      <strong>Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie</strong> (25 June 1936 - 11 September
      2019) was an Indonesian engineer and politician who was the third
      president of Indonesia from 1998 to 1999. Less than three months after his
      inauguration as the seventh vice president in March 1998, he succeeded
      Suharto who resigned after 32 years in office. His presidency was seen as
      a landmark and transition to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president,
      he liberalized Indonesia's press and political party laws, and held an
      early democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which
      resulted in the end of his presidency. His 517-day presidency and 71-day
      vice presidency were the shortest in the country's history. He also
      contributed to the making of Indonesia's first domestic airplane. As a
      result, he was granted the title "Father of Technology". Source:
